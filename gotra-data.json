Middle Ages - 1st Millenium A.D.Historian Dr. Augustus Hoernle was of the opinion that the Tomaras were one of the ruling clans of Gurjars in the Gurjara-Pratihara era of North India- 4th - 8th century AD.; ancient Kuru Kingdom continuing its existence in the ages when India was ruled by Gupta Kings. It remained one of the 18 Great States under Gupta Kings.[9] However; the lineage and existence of the clan predates the Gurjara entry into the Indian subcontinent by two millenias; and may have therefore been allied partners in the empire.Indraprastha - Delhi The modern city of Delhi is believed to be on the site of Indraprastha.[10] Delhi was established in 736CE by the Tomar/Tuar king Anangpal Tomar-I who re-established the Pandava ancestral capital.The Kingdom of Delhi was founded by Gurjar King Anangpal Tomar; whose dynasty; by virtue of descent from the Pandavas; claimed to be Lords Paramount of India —From A Pageant of India by Adolf Simon Waley[11]Anangpal Tomar The Tomara dynasty of Delhi lasted until Anangpal Tomar-II; who to quote Lt. Col. Tod; in his Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan was 'justly entitled to be termed the paramount sovereign of Hindustan'. Anangpal Tomar II appointed his grandson (daughter's son; and son of King of Ajmer); Prithviraj Chauhan; as the heir apparent. Some historians believe that Prithvaraj was merely a caretaker king as long as his grandfather was alive. Prithviraj was never crowned in Delhi; hence adding weight to the view that the Chauhan ruler usurped the throne from his maternal grandfather.[12][citation needed]. Anangpal Tomar II had 23 brothers and they each had territory of their own.[13]According to records kept by bards (or Jagas); King Anangpal Tomar made Prithviraj Chauhan only as caretaker when he went on a religious pilgrimage; as his own sons were very small at that time. When King Anangpal Tomar returned back; Prithviraj refused to hand over the kingdom to his maternal grandfatherToday Gurjars have around 20 villages of Tomar or Tanwar Gujjars in and around Delhi which makes the perception strong that this was originally a Gurjar clan. These Gurjar Tanwars proved to be the toughest repellents to the Britishers in 1857 during the first war of independence. They captured the Matcalfe house for 12 days cutting all supplies to British Armies and declaring independence for Delhi (though for a small period of time only).","related_names":"","source":"meta"},
